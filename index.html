  <h1>Under construction, check out some of my projects and other <em>important</em> links below:</h1>
  <br>
  <h2><a href="https://github.com/Idkbuster40/NotBook">NotBook</a>, a minimalist notebook like program, designed to be very lightweight. Inspired by FocusWriter, but I want a web version of it. It is also not a book, or a notebook. Or ANY kind of BOOK.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2><a href="https://github.com/Idkbuster40/Upperf">Upperf</a>, a mod for minecraft(1.0-1.12.2, current testing is on 1.8.8) which I am still working on, sadly. I am busy with other things, and learning java and all of this is complicated, so it would be helpful to have a helping hand with this project! (Or a few.)</h2>
  <br>
  <h2><a href="https://github.com/Idkbuster40/Tri-d">Tri-d</a>, a command line game engine, which is a fork of my friend's engine I want to make into psedo-3d. I don't want to make more promises but W.I.P.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>My dead <a href="https://youtube.com/@Idkbuster40">YouTube channel</a>, I'll showcase NotBook here soon.<h2>
  <br>
  <h3>And more can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Idkbuster40">GitHub</a> profile.</h3>
  <br>
  <h5>...And I don't know what else to add here. Other than no CSS or JS it's just plain HTML. I'll make a blog here soon, which will also be 100% HTML, no secret ad-scripts. :)</h5>
