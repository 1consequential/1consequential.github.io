  <h1>Under construction, check out some of my projects and other <em>important</em> links below:</h1>
  <br>
  <h2><a href="https://github.com/Idkbuster40/NotBook">NotBook</a>, a minimalist notebook like program, designed to be very lightweight. Inspired by FocusWriter, but I want a web version of it. It is also not a book, or a notebook. Or ANY kind of BOOK.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2><a href="https://github.com/Idkbuster40/ttt_parser">ttt_parser</a>, It's basically a parser for the Tiny Texture Tumbler, which creates textures, but in C for use in a game or other places. Like simple graphics/textures.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2><a href="https://github.com/Idkbuster40/reminders_app">A reminders app</a>, something to <em>irritate</em> me into doing work. This is my primary focus at the moment.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>My dead <a href="https://youtube.com/@Idkbuster40">YouTube channel</a>, I'll showcase some of my projects here soon.<h2>
  <br>
  <h3>And more can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Idkbuster40">GitHub</a> profile.</h3>
  <br>
  <h5>...And I don't know what else to add here. Other than no CSS or JS it's just plain HTML. I'll make a blog here soon, which will also be 100% HTML, no secret ad-scripts. :)
  <br>
  <a href="click_at_your_own_risk.html">Click at your own risk, uses JS to send back to the previous page. You have been warned.</a>
